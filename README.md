# Zeta ABI

ABI is Zeta's cross-program integration ecosystem.

This repository contains the Zeta Cross Program Invocation (CPI) interface as well as a usage example `abi-wrapper`.

```toml
# Add to dependencies
zeta-abi = "1.0.0"
```

## Cross Program Invocations

### Dependencies

- anchor 0.26.0
- solana 0.14.x

### Instructions

The instructions currently supported are as follows:

- `initialize_cross_margin_account` - create and initialize a user's margin account
- `initialize_cross_margin_account_manager` - create and initialize a user's margin account manager
- `initialize_open_orders_v3` - create and initialize user's open orders account
- `deposit_v2` - deposit USDC collateral into the margin account
- `withdraw_v2` - withdraw USDC collateral from the margin account
- `place_perp_order_v3` - place a perp order of (price, size, side) on the relevant market

### Accounts

The accounts and relevant data that is currently supported (non-exhaustive):

  - Fee percentages
  - Admin pubkeys
  - Platform limits
  - Halt state

  - Mark Prices
  - Funding rates
  - Perp and margin params
- `CrossMarginAccount` - individual user margin accounts
  - Balance
  - Positions
  - Orders

## Programs

### abi-wrapper

Basic usage example outlined in a dummy wrapper program, which simply calls the main zeta program instructions. Also includes account layouts and outlines how to read all relevant on-chain data from the Zeta program.
This should give all the boilerplate needed to execute core program functionality both as the smart contract and off-chain client.
